--- COLLISION HANDLER ----

Validates the position and deslocates the camera for a valid position in collision will happen.

# How to create your own:
1- Create a new class that inherits the one.
2- Use the [CreateAssetMenu] attribute on the class so it appers in the asset menu and you will be able to create a .asset object.
Ex: [CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "CollisionHandler_myCollisionHandler", menuName = "Camera Controller Module/CollisionHandler_myCollisionHandler")]

The provided sample collision handler is good enough for most situations. If you have a specific gameplay, you will have to make your own.

You must implement:

-collisionPoints (array): array of collsion points around the camera to antecipate collision.
-StartModule(): Called by the Start() method of the CameraController script.
-CollisionTreatment(): This receives a position and a distance to travel. It check it the position is able to go to the (position + distance to travel).
If the new position (position + distance to travel) is valid, it returns the new position, otherwise it must return a valid position.


Feel free to include any variable that you think you will need in this new class, as well any new methods.


# Keep in mind:
-The collsionPoints array must be implemented in the StartModule() method of the derived class.
-All the tranlation modules send information for this object every frame.
