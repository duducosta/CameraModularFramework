--- EVENT HANDLER ----

Controls the camera states.

# How to create your own:
1- Create a new class that inherits the one.
2- Use the [CreateAssetMenu] attribute on the class so it appers in the asset menu and you will be able to create a .asset object.
Ex: [CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "EventHandler_myEventHandler", menuName = "Camera Controller Module/EventHandler_myEventHandler")]

You should make a custom made eventHandler for your project.

It is optimal for a player that also operates under a FSM.

You must implement the methods:

-SetCameraState(): Called every Camera Update before every thing. Sets the camera state for that frame.
-UpdateData(): Put instructions that should be updated every frame (last position, for instance). This is called by the SetCameraState() method.

Feel free to include any variable that you think you will need in this new class, as well any new methods.


# Keep in mind:
The CameraController ONLY calls the SetCameraState() method.
