--- INITIAL OFFSET ----

Makes the first positioning and rotating of the camera.

# How to create your own:
1- Create a new class that inherits the one.
2- Use the [CreateAssetMenu] attribute on the class so it appers in the asset menu and you will be able to create a .asset object.
Ex: [CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "InitialOffset_mySampleModule", menuName = "Camera Controller Module/SampleModules/SpecialModules/InitialOffset_mySampleModule")]

The provided sample is simple, you should create your own if you have a specific need.

You must implement:

-StartModule(): Called by the Start() method of the CameraController script.


Feel free to include any variable that you think you will need in this new class, as well any new methods.


# Keep in mind:
This is executed only once.
